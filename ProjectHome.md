Note:_This is the **official** home of SACK, while I thank the several other people who hosted my small project on here, this is where SACK will actually be updated from._

SACK is exactly what it says it is: A simple set of code to allow you to put AJAX into your webpages with none of the fuss or overhead of other packages. Just AJAX, just simple.

Current SACK Version: 1.6

This is the main page for SACK and will be, over the next little while, updated with resources and tutorials about how to use SACK to enhance your webpages. Maybe it will even give you some ideas! If you come up with something special please let me know, Iâ€™d love to hear from people that are using my SACK in their projects or products. The same goes for any suggestions, please tell me how I can make this better.

SACK 1.2 is included with WordPress 2.0, which makes me happy beyond words, newer versions of SACK should work with no problems in WordPress.
