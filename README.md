# Simple AJAX Code-Kit (SACK)
_Â©2005 Gregory Wild-Smith_

Hopefully this should get you up-and-running with my SACK and using AJAX to enhance your webpages with lots of fabulous things. If you come up with something special please let me know, I'd love to hear form people that are using my SACK in their projects or products. The same goes for any suggestions, please tell me how I can make this better.

## Code Documentation
Full documentation of the classes methods and variables is available in the docs.html file. This should be more than you need. One day I will put it in the GitHub wiki format...

## Example Code
A basic demonstration of how you can use SACK to communicate with a PHP page is available in the repo (demo.html). This needs to be run on a webserver to work correctly.

## Licence
This is released under the MIT license. It's fully open source.
